# Ansible playbook 

- The ansible playbook does the following actions:- 
        * Updates apt library 
        * Installs docker and docker-compose
        * Builds and runs 3 containers : - 
                - client 
                - backend 
                - database 

- When you run "vagrant up" in the terminal a geerlingguy/ubuntu2004 base virtual machine is spun up 
  and the tasks in the ansible playbook are run.
